# Median-Holder
A data structure with two fast operations: insertion of a number and getting the median of all inserted numbers.

It is a header-only library located in the `Library` subdirectory.

I presume that the numbers are integers and that the insertion and getting the median operations are called with the same order of magnitude.

Time complexity:
- insertion - `0(logN)`
- getting the median - `O(1)`

Space complexity is `0(N)`

(`N` is the count of inserted numbers)

Note that in `Debug` there are going to be slow invariant asserts.

# Building
For build system, I am using CMake.

For example, VS 2015 project files can be generated by the following:
- > cd "MedianHolderRepoDir"
- > mkdir Build
- > cd Build
- > cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

The generated files are going to be in the `Build` directory, where you can start `MedianHolder.sln`

# Automated tests

For the automated tests, I am using the [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) library.
Run the tests via the generated `TestingApp` solution (currently, it's the only solution in the repo).
